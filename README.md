Boardgame Console App ==> 

This was a group project in which we were given a boardgame called "The Hare and the Tortoise" by Gibson. Our group had to create a text based representation of the board game. The IDE's used in the development of this app were Intellij and Eclipse.

# Hare and Tortoise Board Game

• 2 – 6 players

• 15 hare cards

• 18 lettuce cards

• Lots of carrot cards

# This is a race game

• You move by spending carrots (wisely)

• You can move as far as you like, once you have the carrots to pay for it. The more you move, the more you pay

• You start the game with 65 carrots

• You can earn more carrots by landing on certain squares

# Starting the game

• Each player is given 65 carrots

• Each player takes three lettuce cards

• Each player can reference the race card to show the possible moves they can take

# Object of the game

• To get your runner home first

# BUT

• You must:

  – Get rid of all your lettuces on the way round (this is done by landing on the lettuce squares)
  
  – Not have too many carrots left over when you reach home (1st home is allowed up to 10 unused carrots,2nd 20, the 3rd 30, and so on.)
